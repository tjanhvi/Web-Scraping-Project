## Web Scraping Project

 - Developing an automatic Instagram post maker. With the help of Web scraping, I will scrap data from the internet and dump it on my personal website which will be creating and convert that text into a downloadable file (JPEG/PNG).
 - On my website, there will be templates already present, and scrapped data will be dumped on that template only.
Flask framework for back-end, Beautiful Soup for scrapping, Html2Canvas.js for conversion, and HTML, CSS for webpage development will be used.
